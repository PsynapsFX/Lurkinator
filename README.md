# Lurkinator
The "Lurkinator" program is a MultiTwtich-like system I made for streamers to connect and grow. We will launch a new Stream Team and software for members soon!


How to Lurk:
- Run the Lurkinator exe.
- Enter your Twitch name in the app.
- Enter a few streamers you want to watch.
- Press the "Start" button.
- A browser window will open with a multi-Twitch style layout playing your favorite streamers along with the Lurk Team users.
- When you watch using the Lurkinator app, you become a Lurk Team member and will be watched by the other users when you go live. 

You also get points as you watch. This tracks the people who are watching, so each person who is watching and gathering points will remain on the Lurk Team list. The result is those who are using Lurkinator, get played on Lurkinator when they go live. If you don't use the app regularly, you will fall off the list eventually. The best way to use it, 1.) have it running as much as possible, 2.) use it on your main computer or use spare ones, 3.) and of course you don't have to run it all the time unless you want to support your fav streamers even more!

More details soon, if you have questions just ask! If you have feature requests, please request.
